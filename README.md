# Fremont-Bridge-Bicycle-Traffic-Analysis

Thanks to Jake Vanderplas for putting the layout of this analysis together. I am happy to have learned the majority of my Data Science Knowledge from your priceless book (Python Data Science Handbook).
Also, I am happy to have personally contributed to this dataset, as riding a bicycle over the Fremont Bridge was part of my daily commute for 2 years.
